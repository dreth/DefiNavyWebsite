## Our experiment

Hi!, welcome to DeFi Navy. We're a small team of dudes that want to make the world of DeFi a little easier to explore. *Dozens* of people are building super cool sites for many different purposes, exploring blockchain data, dapps, news, media, all sorts of things. These are super hard to track, since they're shared around in forums and there's SO many popping up at the same time. 

We want to make the simplest possible website to find relevant DeFi links, no bullshit, no ads, just links.

We hope you enjoy the site and we hope we can help you find what you're looking for.

This project is open source, so anyone is welcome to contribute. Check out our [contribution guide](https://defi.navy/contributionguide) to add your own links, or maybe even correct ours if they're wrong!

Thanks for checking out the site, we hope you like it!
