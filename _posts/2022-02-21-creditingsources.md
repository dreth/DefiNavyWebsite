## Credit where credit's due

We use external resources to create the site, the main and most important one is the [**defillama.com API**](https://defillama.com), not all the data from the API is used, only a couple endpoints, but without these, the **dapps** sections would be a nightmare to collect links for. **Thanks** to the Defi llama team for providing this data and allowing it to be publicly available and free to use. 

Only the dapps sections contain data obtained from their API. We also **do not** query the API every time any page is loaded or modified. Instead, we query the API every few days/weeks to keep the site updated with protocol URLs, audit links and so on. We do not persistently query to gather TVL data, TVL is only used to order links on some pages.
